# RomanNumeralConverter
For the BYU OIT Job Application - Code Challenge

I wrote this as a basic web application. Simply download the files onto your computer and open them in a web browser.

I spent just under two hours to build the Javascript logic used to convert the numerals. THen I spend about an hour and ten minutes adding and styling the HTML and CSS front-end, adding comments, simplifying the logic of the code, and then adding some error states.
